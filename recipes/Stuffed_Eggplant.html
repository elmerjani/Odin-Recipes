        <div class="directions">
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ul>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.

                    </p>

                </li>
              
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty and browned, about 10 minutes more.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
